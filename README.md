# [Intro to Coding](https://github.com/geekmdtravis/intro-to-coding)

## Goals

The focus of this introductory session is to give each participate an understanding of:

- Do I need a computer science degree to become a high-earning software engineer?
- Basic concepts of computer programming.
- Commonly used introductory programming languages.
- My choice of introductory programming languages.
- Major tools commonly used in computer programming and **why** they're used.
- Where and how to begin learning to program **without** a complex development environment.
- Where I would suggest learning to becoming a computer programmer.

## Do I need a computer science degree to become a high-earning software engineer?

_Absolutely not._ I do not consider myself to be an expert in the area of hiring, but my personal experience and shared anecdotes the degree helps you getting intro jobs when you lack a portfolio of work. However, once you have a portfolio of work that demonstrates your capability the meritocratic culture in software engineering tends to take over.

### What is a portfolio of work?

It's really anything that displays your skill. If you've had jobs previously, that work experience will be much of your portfolio. If you're self-taught, you'll want to put your projects on [GitHub](https://github.com) (or similar) and if possible find ways to contribute to open source tools (earlier said than done).

### How can I contribute to open source projects?

This is a bit easier said than done, and you're likely a thinking a few steps too far ahead. ^\_^ Open source projects often have a quite high standard for code contributions. But, there are many ways to contribute. I will defer this entire conversation to the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).
